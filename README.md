# Diabetic-Retinopathy
Project Title:
Interactive Joint Feature Extraction for Diabetic Retinopathy Classification using Multiple Instance Neural Symbolic Learning

This academic project focuses on early detection of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), a serious eye disease caused by diabetes. We developed a system that uses advanced deep learning techniques to classify retinal images. The main goal is to extract meaningful features from retinal images and classify them using a neural-symbolic learning approach. This helps in accurate identification of DR stages.

The HTML frontend included in this repository serves as a user interface for uploading retinal images and displaying the prediction results. It is designed with simplicity and responsiveness for better user interaction.
